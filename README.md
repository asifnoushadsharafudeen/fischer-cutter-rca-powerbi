## ðŸ“˜ Project Summary
We studied downtime and process instability in a high-speed tire manufacturing line (RH Calender â†’ Fischer Cutter), analyzing multiple fault types using real secondary data collected from the field â€” including shift engineer reports, PLC logs, and RCA documentation.

Using Power BI, we built a decision-support dashboard for engineers and plant managers to identify bottlenecks and visualize fault trends across machines, shifts, and compounds.

As a result, we diagnosed critical machine-level issues and implemented corrective actions â€” including design and control recommendations formally communicated to the OEM, resulting in upgrades to subsequent machine deliveries.

The insights also revealed a strong correlation between compound properties, calender roll temperature drift, and cutter behavior, enabling data-driven process parameter changes across multiple plant locations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Problem
The Fischer Cutter was experiencing frequent unplanned stoppages and product rejections â€” leading to significant downtime and quality issues.

**Key pain points included:**
- Unexplained sequence missing faults disrupting the cutâ€“parkâ€“splice cycle
- Change Over Plate jams, particularly with certain compound types â€” closely linked to Gum Edge issues originating from the RH Calender
- Splice sensor failures caused by dust, timing mismatches, or calibration drift
- Roll temperature fluctuations in the RH Calender (especially the bottom roll)
- Feeding method inconsistencies causing material uncoat and gripper jams
- HMI and PLC logic delays, especially during manual override attempts

**Goals:**
- Understand recurring fault root causes
- Link breakdowns to shifts, machine conditions, and materials
- Implement engineering and control-based solutions
- Build a Power BI dashboard to support decision-making

## ðŸ“Š Data Description
All data used in this analysis was collected from real field operations and cross-verified through engineering review. The data sources included:

- Shift engineer logs
- PLC/HMI tag logs
- Root Cause Analysis reports
- RH Calender roll temperature logs
- Compound test reports (T5, T35, Mooney viscosity, reclaim %, batch origin)

**Each record includes:**
- Date & Shift
- Machine ID
- Fault Type & Duration
- Compound properties
- Operator or engineering notes

The hybrid dataset enabled both trend-based and engineering-logic-based insights.
